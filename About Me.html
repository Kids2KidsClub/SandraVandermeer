<h2>My Name and Me</h2>
<p>Hi and welcome to my page about me! My name is Sandra A. Vandermeer and I am 9 years old. I love cats and dogs the same. But if I had to choose which one I liked more, I would pick cat. My favorite book is Katt vs. Dogg which  was written by James Patterson. But my favorite author is J.K Rowling. She wrtes the Harry Potter series. My favorite video game is  game called<a href="https://www.animaljam.com/welcome?ast=1&utm_expid=.GGmVtV86Sp64EVunO8_5fw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F"target="_blank"> Animal Jam</a> . Before you press the link to my favorite game, when you get a acount (if you want one), then when the beguinners Peck show is over, then press the two animals and press, How Did You Hear? and type in Kittenlily227.</p>
<p>Soo, my favorite thing to do is typing stories or writing them because when im writing, my mind expands and I think of things that I never think of before. My favorite kind of writin is fiction, but things like making my own website, I would do anything to go write. I also love coding things like robots and websites. I know that the computer takes in the informaton that you give it, but it can't read words like these. So, if you put in the wrong the code, the computer won't know what you want and it won't give you what your code said it wanted it to do. I also love being around my friends and telling jokes to them. But the jokes are on another page, called Funny Jokes. I have a good humor and tell jokes in such a way that makes my friends laugh, even if it is a bad joke. My mom lets me do karate so, I am a strong kid. I enjoy practicig with Saya Phil. My favorire food is all different kinds of fruit.</p>
<p>Some things that trouble me is things like if someone is really mad at me, and is screaming at me, I break down, stop thinking and start to cry. Things like that get me too depressed. I also get depressed if I don't get my way, or if I don't get what I want. Someone has to tell you this so, I will. I am a spoiled kid.</p>
